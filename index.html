                Hello!! I’m an artist and photographer from New Zealand. I go by <b>he/him</b> and I love tramping, video games, and technology. 
                I’m currently studying web design and development. This site was originally built for the purpose of hosting my other smaller projects
                but now I just keep working on it because I enjoy making stuff.
            </p>
            <small>I dunno what else to put here lel</small>

                            Woah its been a while since I made another update! I've yet again re-organized how a lot of the code is structured, including 
                            moving source files into <code>src/</code> and all the distrabutable code into <code>dist/</code>. Hopefully this should make
                            things a little bit easier for myself to maintain in the future. The site was pretty much re-built from the ground up as I wanted
                            to split my original <code>main.scss</code> file into multiple partials, again, for maintainance and readability purposes. I also
                            made that little 24-hour clock widget you might have noticed in the bottom-left corner. It displays the current time in my local timezone
                            (NZST) so hopefully that helps someone out :].

                            In other news... I've bought a motorbike! It's a 2017 Suzuki GW250. A decent upgrade from my 50cc scooter. As of writing I'm
                            still in the process of aquiring all the neccesary gear but it feels great having a lot more power behind me on the road. I think that's
                            all for now anyways.

                            Finally started implementing some stuff I've wanted here for a while - including this blog. On the backend it's extremely simple
                            (All of these posts are written manually in HTML because idfk how else to do it without overcomplexifying everything for myself
                            (aka im stupid)). I'll prolly keep this blog at a maxiumum of like 15 posts at a time or so and archive the older posts just to 
                            make it run a little cleaner. Also optimized some of the SCSS code to make it more readable..... hopefully. If something doesn't 
                            look right or you think there's a better approach to something I've done here feel free to open an
