                Hello!! I’m an artist and photographer from New Zealand. I go by <b>he/him</b> and I love tramping, video games, and technology. 
                I’m currently studying web design and development. I tend to be pretty anxious and timid (especially around new people), 
                so if you wanna say something by all means feel free to DM but please know I can't hold a conversation for long!
            </p>

                            Finally started implementing some stuff I've wanted here for a while - including this blog. On the backend it's extremely simple
                            (All of these posts are written manually in HTML because idfk how else to do it without overcomplexifying everything for myself
                            (aka im stupid)). I'll prolly keep this blog at a maxiumum of like 15 posts at a time or so and archive the older posts just to 
                            make it run a little cleaner. Also optimized some of the SCSS code to make it more readable..... hopefully. If something doesn't
